## 💡 **Quick Plan: Inventory via Photo + ChatGPT**

### ✅ 1. Upload/ingest image from your phone
- Could be via `images/` folder or web upload

### ✅ 2. Vision API analysis
- Use GPT-4-turbo with Vision to get:
  - Object type(s)
  - Category/domain
  - Suggested name/label
  - Notes (e.g., *“3 USB-C cables, short, red”*)

### ✅ 3. Store entry in a simple DB
- SQLite or JSON for now

```json
{
  "item": "USB-C cable",
  "description": "Short, red, braided",
  "photo": "usb1.jpg",
  "location": "desk bin",
  "tags": ["usb", "cable", "red"],
  "timestamp": "2025-04-19T14:00:00"
}
```

### ✅ 4. Query interface
- Text queries:
  - “Show me everything tagged HDMI”
  - “Where are my red cables?”
  - “What gear do I have in office shelf 2?”

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Part | Tool |
|------|------|
| Photo → AI | ChatGPT Vision (me, or your own API) |
| Web/API | FastAPI or Flask |
| Storage | SQLite or flat JSON to start |
| Deployment | Run in K8s (or locally first) |
| Frontend | HTML upload + query, or basic CLI for now |

---

## 🛠 Want to start with:

1. 📁 A photo drop folder + script that analyzes and logs?
2. 🌐 A simple FastAPI web app with:
   - `/upload` → photo + auto-analysis
   - `/query` → text query interface
3. 📄 A schema + test data + CLI query tool?
