# Temporal Belonging & Lifecycle-Aware Item Tracking

Your belongings aren't static—they move through phases. This system should understand and respect the *temporal nature of stuff*.

---

## 🔄 Soft Belonging

Items may be:
- In use
- Mid-project
- "On hold" without a current place
- Set aside with intent

Instead of forgetting or misplacing these, mark them as:
> `soft_belonging: active (out since YYYY-MM-DD)`

This allows the system to:
- Track location drift
- Remind you later
- Suggest actions

---

## ⏳ Return to Order

After a set interval (e.g., 30 days), the system can ask:
- “This cable has been sitting out for 34 days. Want to return it to `office/cable-bin`?”
- “This board was last used in 'pi-dock' setup. Still active?”

---

## 🚫 Zone Protection

Before adding an item to a clean or curated zone:
- System warns if the zone is:
  - Overfilled
  - Has too many unclassified items
  - Conflicts with existing item types

---

## 📦 Intent-Based Reorganization

You can also ask:
- “What’s ready to go back?”
- “What areas are filling with deferred objects?”
- “Show me items untouched since last month that were marked temporary.”

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Humans don’t organize perfectly in the moment.  
This feature allows for:
- Natural creative mess  
- Structured reentry into order  
- Forgiveness + nudges without judgment

It supports how we **really live**, not how we think we *should*.
