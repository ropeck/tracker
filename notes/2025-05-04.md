### 🛠️ Tracker App Progress

### 🧪 Testing & Development

* **GCS Rebuild**: Implemented a `should_rebuild_db` method to determine when to rebuild the database from GCS. Added support for a `force` argument via environment variable and URL parameter.
* **Uvicorn Configuration**: Opted to use environment variables for passing arguments to Uvicorn. Set `FORCE_REBUILD` in the Kubernetes YAML to trigger a rebuild.
* **Code Enhancements**: Refactored `rebuild_db_from_gcs` for improved readability and added comprehensive docstrings. Ensured that comments wrap at 80 columns in VS Code for consistency.
* **Testing**: Conducted local testing to confirm that the rebuild logic works as expected. Verified that the database rebuilds when `FORCE_REBUILD` is set and skips when it's not.

### 🧠 Reflections

* It's satisfying to see the office space organized and the tracker app functioning smoothly. The combination of physical cleanup and code refinement has been rejuvenating. Looking forward to wrapping up the day with a well-deserved beer and planning the next steps for the project.
