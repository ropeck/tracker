## ðŸ““ Daily Notes â€“ 2025-05-05

### âœ… Work Completed

* **\[HOME-2] Daily DB Backup to GCS**

  * Implemented `/backup-now` FastAPI route.
  * Uploads SQLite backup (`backup-YYYY-MM-DD.sqlite3`) to GCS if changes are detected.
  * Added file deduplication via hash check to avoid redundant uploads.
  * Backup retention:

    * Keeps at least 15 backups.
    * Deletes older backups >30 days, unless needed to satisfy min retention.
  * Auth allows:

    * Logged-in OAuth2 users (`get_current_user()` in allowlist)
    * Kubernetes service accounts (`sub` in JWT allowlist)
  * Configured via:

    * `ALLOWED_USER_EMAILS`
    * `ALLOWED_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_IDS`

### ðŸ”§ Infra Work

* Drafted CronJob YAML for K8s to invoke `/backup-now` daily at 3:00 AM UTC.
* Curl-based auth using service account token injected into the CronJob pod.
* Planning secret-based env injection for auth values in future iterations.

### ðŸ§  Follow-Up Ideas

* Add unit tests for `authorize_backup_request()`
* Add CLI for local triggering of backup via internal HTTP call
* Optional: Decorator for RBAC-style route guards
