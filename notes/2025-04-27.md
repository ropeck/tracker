# 📋 Goals You Just Described

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| 🛠️ Add queuing | Queue the Vision API/image processing instead of blocking during upload |
| 🛠️ Show tags for each photo | Display tags (objects/summary) in the photo gallery view |
| 🛠️ Show uploaded photo immediately | After upload, show the uploaded photo + summary without needing a manual refresh |

# 🛠 Summary of Upgrades

| Feature | Status |
|:--------|:-------|
| ✅ Background queue for image processing | (fast uploads, async backend) |
| ✅ Display tags next to each photo | (improved gallery info) |
| ✅ Instant upload preview | (better feedback to user) |

---

# 🌟 Bonus Tip

Later, you could **persist the queue** into Redis or SQLite if you want full reliability across restarts —
but for now, in-memory `asyncio.Queue()` is *perfect* and keeps it simple.

# 📋 Pull Request Clean Checklist for `feature/async-upload-processing`

---

## 1. Code Check
- [ ] Confirm upload still works normally (no breaking the basic path)
- [ ] Background queue (`asyncio.Queue`) successfully processes images
- [ ] Uploaded photo preview appears correctly after upload
- [ ] Tags display correctly in the photo gallery next to thumbnails

---

## 2. Code Cleanliness
- [ ] No leftover print/debug statements
- [ ] Logging uses `logging.info()` or `logging.exception()` as appropriate
- [ ] File and function names match your usual clean style (snake_case, descriptive)

---

## 3. Git Hygiene
- [ ] If needed, **squash commits** to keep the history tight and meaningful
- [ ] Write a simple but useful PR title and description

### Example PR title:
```text
Async Upload Queue + Gallery Tags + Immediate Upload Preview
```

### Example PR description:
```markdown
- Implemented asyncio-based background processing queue for uploads
- Added immediate preview of uploaded photo after success
- Gallery now shows tags extracted from vision analysis
- Minor cleanup and better error handling in upload processing
```

✅ Clear and short — **shows progress without overexplaining**

---

# 🧠 Bonus if You Want Extra Polish
- [ ] Quick manual test uploading from phone (camera snap) and from desktop (file picker)
- [ ] Quick test of `/photos` with and without a query (`?q=tag`) search

✅ Just a few uploads — doesn't have to be exhaustive
