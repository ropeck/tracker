# Daily Notes – April 23, 2025

## 🗓️ Planned Tasks

### 🗃️ SQLite Metadata Integration
- [ ] Create database tables (`images`, `tags`, `image_tags`, `users`)
- [ ] Store upload metadata (filename, timestamp, label, tags) in SQLite on each upload
- [ ] Refactor `metadata.json` usage to DB-backed queries

### 🔍 Search & Filtering
- [ ] Implement `/photos?q=<tag>` filter using DB-backed lookup
- [ ] Make tags in the gallery clickable → link to tag-filtered photo view
- [ ] Add optional search input to `/photos` page

### 🧪 Local Testing
- [ ] Test upload + DB flow locally with SQLite before deploying to GKE
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with previously uploaded GCS images

## 🚧 Stretch Goals (Optional)
- [ ] Display label + notes alongside tags in gallery
- [ ] Begin wiring up Firestore logic (for future cloud-native metadata)
- [ ] Add a simple CLI script to query recent uploads Vby tag or date

## 🧘 Dev Environment Tasks
- [ ] Add `notes/2025-04-23.md`
- [ ] Run `db init` script if SQLite doesn’t exist
- [ ] Create migration script to backfill tags from `.summary.txt` into DB

## 🧑‍💼 Work Tasks
- [ ] Finish remaining WEKA-U training modules before end of the week
- [ ] Review content and prepare for Christina's evaluation
- [ ] Self-quiz to identify knowledge gaps ahead of review
