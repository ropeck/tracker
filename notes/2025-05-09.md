## 🗓️ Daily Tracker Log – Thursday, May 8, 2025

### ✅ Goals for the Day

* [x] Get all unit and integration tests passing without modifying production `logger.py`.
* [x] Patch and isolate necessary components using `unittest.mock` (e.g., `UPLOAD_DIR`, `get_current_user`, `aiosqlite.connect`, `storage.Client`).
* [x] Catch up on all failing tests from `test_logger.py`, `test_logger_extra.py`, and `test_logger_final.py`.
* [x] Verify full test suite passes before any code refactor.

---

### 🧪 Testing Progress

* **✔ `tests/test_logger.py`** – All core upload and route tests passing
* **✔ `tests/test_logger_extra.py`** – Proxy, search query, rebuild, and backup logic validated
* **✔ `tests/test_logger_final.py`** – Lifespan, cleanup, and error path tests corrected
* ✅ Patched multiple tests to use real temporary files and proper mocks for:

  * `UPLOAD_DIR` override
  * GCS `upload_file_to_gcs` mocking
  * Auth logic and session dependency
  * SQLite backup behavior

---

### 🔍 Notable Fixes

* 🐛 Mocked `upload_from_file` wasn’t being called due to `seek()` placement — fixed with correct patch + call tracking.
* 🐛 `UPLOAD_DIR` was pointing to a real `uploads/` dir instead of the test path — fixed via patch in `test_search_query_logic`.
* 🐛 GCS proxy tests were failing due to `content_type` returning a `MagicMock` — fixed by explicitly setting it to `"image/jpeg"`.
* 🐛 Lifespan triggered a background job unexpectedly in test — resolved by asserting call or patching the job runner.
* 🐛 Backup cleanup test forgot to `await` the async cleanup coroutine — fixed + deprecated `utcnow()` replaced.

### 📦 Summary

All 53 tests are passing (`make test`) as of this push.
No changes were made to production app code — all fixes were in test coverage and mocking behavior.

## 📅 Daily Notes – Friday, May 9, 2025

### ✅ Accomplishments

- 🧪 Resolved final test case for `test_search_query_response`, addressing missing table errors.
- 🔧 Improved dependency override logic for FastAPI tests.
- ✅ All 54 unit tests are now passing.
- 📈 Coverage now at 88.91% (threshold passed).
- 🧼 Cleaned up unused overrides and improved test DB handling logic.
- 🗂️ Verified all app routes (`/photos`, `/search/query`) return expected output in tests.

### 🧠 Learnings

- Pre-initializing DB schema in test setup avoids race conditions from async overrides.
- Using `logger_get_db` consistently helps ensure override injection works.
- Coverage is a useful forcing function for isolating test gaps—especially around HTML rendering paths.

### 🔜 Next Steps

- Refactor `logger.py` into smaller modules (e.g., `/upload`, `/search`, `/admin`).
- Add tests for less-covered code blocks like `/rebuild`, `/backup-now`, and error cases.
- Begin cleanup of startup logic in `lifespan()` to make local dev faster.
