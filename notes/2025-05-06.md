# 2025-05-06 – Restore DB Snapshot & Delta Sync

## ✅ Features

- **Snapshot Restore**: Implemented `restore_db_from_gcs_snapshot()` to automatically restore the latest `.sqlite3` backup from GCS if the local database is missing or empty.
- **Delta Sync**: Enhanced `rebuild_db_from_gcs()` to accept an optional `since_timestamp` parameter, allowing the application of `summary.txt` deltas created after the snapshot.
- **Automated Backup**: After applying deltas, the system performs a fresh backup using `perform_gcs_backup()` to ensure the latest state is preserved.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Added `/healthz` endpoint to provide a simple health check, returning the current status and image count.

## 🧪 Testing

- Verified that the application restores the snapshot and applies deltas correctly during startup.
- Confirmed that the `/healthz` endpoint returns the expected status and data.

## 📝 Notes

- This update enhances the application's resilience by ensuring that the database can be restored and kept up-to-date automatically.
