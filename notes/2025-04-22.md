# Daily Notes – April 22, 2025

## 🎯 Goals & Achievements
- ✅ GKE deployment successful
- ✅ Image upload via FastAPI to GCS confirmed working
- ✅ Thumbnails and summaries uploaded to GCS with consistent naming
- ✅ OpenAI Vision summary returned and saved as `.summary.txt`
- ✅ Proxy route `/uploads/{filename}` added to serve GCS files
- ✅ Gallery loads from GCS thumbs
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow set up to build Docker image and (mostly) deploy to GKE

## 🧪 Observations
- GitHub Actions is building and pushing `fogcat5/home-app`, but final GKE image rollout may need permissions tuning
- Upload works both locally and in GKE
- `:v12` container tag used to force image pull on GKE
- MIME type guessing and `Content-Disposition: inline` fixes allow images to display in-browser instead of triggering download
- Thumbnail filtering case-sensitive (`.JPG`, `.jpeg`, `.png`) — resolved with `.lower()` extension check

## 🛠️ Next Up
- Integrate SQLite to store image metadata (filename, timestamp, label, tags)
- Extract `.summary.txt` info into DB at upload time
- Implement basic tag search (via `/photos?q=`)
- Add tag-based filtering UI (clickable tags)
- UI improvements and layout cleanup later this week
- Consider move to Firestore once the local DB flow is clear

## 🍻 Dev Vibe
- Code soundtrack: Brad Mehldau – "Look for the Silver Lining"
- IPA rotation: Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’ → Atomic Torpedo IPA
- No standups. No blockers. Just beer-fueled progress.
- Project motto coined: "Trade PMs for
