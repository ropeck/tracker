### ðŸ§ª Testing & Deployment Pipeline

* **Unit Tests Added**: Created test suites for key modules including `db.py`, `rebuild.py`, `vision.py`, `util.py`, `auth.py`, and `logger_nfc.py`. Used `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `pytest-cov` to ensure full coverage and reliability.
* **GCS Summary Parsing**: Validated that images with empty `summary.txt` files are handled correctly and donâ€™t trigger tag creation. Ensured timestamp-based filtering behaves as expected.
* **OpenAI Mocking**: Refactored `vision.py` to make the OpenAI client injectable. This allows mocking during tests and avoids requiring a real API key during import or test runs.
* **GitHub Actions**: Set up a `test-and-coverage.yml` workflow to run on every push and PR. Configured coverage thresholds and HTML report upload for visibility.
* **Prod Deployment Workflow**: Updated the `deploy-proy.yml` to depend on test success. It now runs only if the `test-and-coverage` workflow passes, ensuring broken builds donâ€™t reach production.
* **Badge Added**: Included a live status badge in `README.md` to reflect the current test suite health.
