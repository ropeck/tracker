# Daily Notes – April 21, 2025

## 🎯 Goals & Achievements
- ✅ Set up GCS integration for storing uploaded images
- ✅ Implemented `upload_file_to_gcs()` with service account credentials
- ✅ Uploaded images, thumbnails, and `.summary.txt` successfully to bucket
- ✅ Generated Vision API summary on upload via OpenAI
- ✅ Confirmed working upload via local FastAPI with Docker
- ✅ Started using tag summary in `.summary.txt` for gallery filtering

## 🧰 Dev Work
- Modified FastAPI upload route to include summary generation and storage
- Added support for thumbnail creation with PIL
- Created basic `db.md` with schema for current SQLite and planned Firestore structure
- Gallery shows uploaded images with hardcoded local files (initial version)
- Designed planned `/uploads/{filename}` proxy route (GCS-backed)

## 💡 Random Ideas & Notes
- Serve uploaded images via `/uploads` proxy for consistent auth + access
- Store `.summary.txt` with each image for tag-based search later
- Use OpenAI to identify common objects in household/tool photos
- Sketch vision: AI-assisted memory of object locations and zones (tool tracking, home lab organization)

## ☁️ Infra Notes
- Mounted GCP service account key into container via volume
- Tested GCS upload with both ADC and explicit key
- Plan to clean up GCS paths (`upload/`, `thumb/`, `summary/`)

## 🍻 Vibe of the Day
- Rooftop hacking session on the MacBook
- Cold IPA, background jazz, no meetings
- Beer of the day: Racer 5 + Lagunitas Little Sumpin’
- Felt like progress was organic and fun

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- Implement gallery display from GCS (instead of local PVC)
- Add GCS proxy route
- Refactor upload route to normalize file extensions
- Begin metadata cleanup and move into SQLite or Firestore
- Automate deploys to GKE via GitHub Actions
