## ✅ Completed Today

- **SQLite Integration**
  - Implemented `scripts/db.py` with helper functions: `init_db()`, `add_image()`, `add_tag()`, and `link_image_tag()`.
  - Integrated database operations into the upload pipeline, storing image metadata and associated tags.

- **Gallery Enhancements**
  - Updated `/photos` route to fetch and display images and tags from the SQLite database.
  - Enabled tag-based filtering in the gallery view.

- **Testing and Validation**
  - Conducted local testing of image uploads and gallery functionality.
  - Verified that uploaded images and tags are correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
  - also verified working on GKE in prod

## 🧠 Notes & Observations

- Initial attempts to link images and tags in the database revealed a missing `init_db()` call, which was subsequently added to ensure the database is initialized before operations.
- Encountered an `AttributeError` due to the use of `execute_fetchone` instead of `fetchone` in `aiosqlite`. Corrected the function calls to use the appropriate method.
- The AI-generated summaries are currently stored as plain text. Future improvements could involve parsing these summaries to extract structured tags or object details for more precise filtering.

## 📋 Next Steps

- **Feature Enhancements**
  - Develop a CLI tool to query the API for images based on tags or other metadata.
  - Refine the AI summary processing to extract structured tags, enhancing search and categorization capabilities.

- **Infrastructure**
  - Implement a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Kubernetes to ensure the SQLite database persists across pod restarts.
