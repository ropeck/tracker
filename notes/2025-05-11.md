# ✅ Tracker App Final Push: "Beer by Deployment" Checklist

## Heading

### 🧪 1. **Tests Clean and Green**

* [ ] Fix remaining test failures (e.g., GCS 404s, missing service account)
* [ ] Patch async `open()` issue (switch to `aiofiles.open`)
* [ ] Resolve logging format bug (`log.exception("... %s", filename)` not \`"{}\`\`)
* [ ] Add coverage for recently added functions (like `/rebuild` route)
* [ ] Run full `pytest` suite locally

### 🛠️ 2. **Refactor + Lint**

* [ ] Break up `logger.py` into smaller modules (routes, utils, GCS, DB)
* [ ] Run `ruff`, `black`, and `mypy` clean across repo
* [ ] Update imports and module structure in tests

### 🚀 3. **Production Deploy**

* [ ] Verify prod `.env` and service account keys mounted correctly
* [ ] Deploy latest image to prod environment (via GitHub or manual)
* [ ] Smoke test key endpoints (`/search`, `/upload`, `/rebuild`)

### 🔒 4. **Security + Auth**

* [ ] Ensure `/rebuild` and other admin routes are auth-protected
* [ ] Validate OAuth login still works for uploads
* [ ] Confirm HTTPS redirect and cert still valid

### 📜 5. **Docs + Tags**

* [ ] Update README with final endpoints, env vars, auth instructions
* [ ] Bump version tag in `pyproject.toml` or tag release on GitHub
* [ ] Make `CHANGELOG.md` or markdown update summary for v1
