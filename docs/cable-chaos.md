# USB-C Cable Chaos: A Living Archive

## Observation

- All USB-C is not created equal
- You end up with:
  - Charging-only
  - Thunderbolt-only
  - Video+data+charging
  - "Who-knows cables" in a drawer

## Your Current System

- Throw all cables in a box
- When box is full, move the newest ones to another box
- Repeat until every box is mostly mystery again

## The Fix (via Tracker)

- Add NFC tags to high-quality cables
- Store:
  - Type, power rating, data speed
  - Length, color
  - Date acquired
- Ask: “Do I have a 100W USB4 cable with video support?”
- Scan and inventory in seconds

Future-proof the drawer.
