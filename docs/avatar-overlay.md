# AvatarTalk: Animated Zoom Proxy Avatars

A fun and functional project to enhance video meetings by assigning animated avatars to speakers.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Replace static speaker thumbnails or awkward webcams with expressive, animated avatars that:
- React to voice activity
- Switch based on speaker
- Reflect personality or tone
- Display on dock screen or as overlay

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** – lights up the active avatar
- **Speaker Switching** – highlights the current person talking
- **Avatar Personality** – choose per participant (fox, robot, cat, etc.)
- **Audio Emotion Detection** – change facial expressions by tone

---

## 🎛️ Display Modes

- On side screen of dock
- As a local desktop overlay
- Rendered to a virtual webcam (OBS-style) to show in Zoom/Meet
- Idle mode with low energy animations

---

## 🎨 Styles

- Pixel creatures
- Emoji heads
- Minimalist silhouettes
- Classic internet animals (e.g. Squirrel Ranzo, Fox Lisa, Owl Brion)

---

## ⚙️ Stretch Goals

- Zoom API integration for speaker ID
- Movement mimicry via video (head bob, blink)
- Local avatar config manager
- Meeting transcript display companion
- Twitch-stream mode for fun commentary bots

---

## 🔥 Why It’s Better Than the Metaverse™

- No headsets
- No corporate vibes
- No uncanny valley
- Just expressive, useful meeting enhancements that make you smile
