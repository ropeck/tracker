# Tracker Ideas

- Trip checklist generator based on recent tag scans
- Donation mode: suggest unused or duplicate items
- NFC tags for bins, drawers, shelves, individual tools
- Query system: "Where is X?", "Do I already have one?"
- Zone-based prompts: "You're near untagged gear"
- Cat zone tracker: last seen timestamp per collar tag
- Battery domain: track charge state, last used, trip readiness
