# Tracker Project: MVP Progress and TODOs

**Project Purpose**: AI-assisted physical inventory system with photo uploads, vision-based tagging, and smart querying.

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] FastAPI + Uvicorn app with image upload.
- [x] Image metadata stored with thumbnails and tags.
- [x] GPT-4 Vision API integration (OpenAI).
- [x] Basic web gallery (`/photos`) with summaries.
- [x] Querying images by tag/summary via `/photos?q=wireless` etc.
- [x] Deployed to Kubernetes (`home.fogcat5.com`) with Docker image.
- [x] OAuth2 Google login required for uploads.
- [x] Environment secrets for keys via Kubernetes.
- [x] Tested from mobile: working live uploads and tagging.

## üü° In Progress
- [ ] Clean up / tighten Docker image (remove venv, static files)
- [ ] Auto-generate tags for older images (backfill)
- [x] Improve result display styling (no raw JSON, just tags)
- [ ] Add Makefile or helper scripts for build & deploy

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Next Priorities
- [ ] **Async tag processing queue**
  - Avoid blocking upload requests during OpenAI Vision call
  - Add status: ‚ÄúPending‚Ä¶‚Äù then refresh with result
- [ ] **Tag model/brand if known**
  - Secondary prompt or enhanced prompt chain
  - Possibly request user for alternate views of item
- [ ] **Admin utilities**
  - Re-tag button for refining image labels
  - Mark/tag stale or unplaced items
- [ ] **Search UX**
  - Add filter by date, recent, or room
  - Show zone/area scores ("what‚Äôs out of place?")
- [ ] **README + docs**
  - Include project purpose, architecture, screenshots, pricing info
  - Add contributor guidelines if open-sourced

### ‚≠ê UI & Tag Interaction
- [ ] Add ‚Äú‚≠ê Favorite‚Äù marker for photos (toggle per user or system-wide)
- [ ] Allow user to:
  - [ ] Add new tags to photos
  - [ ] Remove incorrect or noisy tags
  - [ ] Edit tag names (with validation)
- [ ] Render tags on photo results as pill-style labels with rounded background
  - [ ] Make each tag clickable ‚Üí filters search by that tag

### üìä Tag Explorer
- [ ] Show count of photos per tag in the **Top Tags** section
- [ ] Add a scrollable, sortable **Tag Index** page:
  - [ ] Sort by name or photo count
  - [ ] Paginate the list for usability (50‚Äì100 tags per page)
  - [ ] Option to filter by prefix or substring

### üîÅ General Enhancements
- [ ] Add `favorite` field to DB schema and photo model
- [ ] Create `/favorites` route to view starred images
- [ ] Add audit log for manual tag edits (optional, but useful for undo/debug)
