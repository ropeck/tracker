# Tracker Project: MVP Progress and TODOs

**Project Purpose**: AI-assisted physical inventory system with photo uploads, vision-based tagging, and smart querying.

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] FastAPI + Uvicorn app with image upload.
- [x] Image metadata stored with thumbnails and tags.
- [x] GPT-4 Vision API integration (OpenAI).
- [x] Basic web gallery (`/photos`) with summaries.
- [x] Querying images by tag/summary via `/photos?q=wireless` etc.
- [x] Deployed to Kubernetes (`home.fogcat5.com`) with Docker image.
- [x] OAuth2 Google login required for uploads.
- [x] Environment secrets for keys via Kubernetes.
- [x] Tested from mobile: working live uploads and tagging.

## üü° In Progress
- [ ] Clean up / tighten Docker image (remove venv, static files)
- [ ] Auto-generate tags for older images (backfill)
- [ ] Improve result display styling (no raw JSON, just tags)
- [ ] Add Makefile or helper scripts for build & deploy

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Next Priorities
- [ ] **Async tag processing queue**
  - Avoid blocking upload requests during OpenAI Vision call
  - Add status: ‚ÄúPending‚Ä¶‚Äù then refresh with result
- [ ] **Tag model/brand if known**
  - Secondary prompt or enhanced prompt chain
  - Possibly request user for alternate views of item
- [ ] **Admin utilities**
  - Re-tag button for refining image labels
  - Mark/tag stale or unplaced items
- [ ] **Search UX**
  - Add filter by date, recent, or room
  - Show zone/area scores ("what‚Äôs out of place?")
- [ ] **README + docs**
  - Include project purpose, architecture, screenshots, pricing info
  - Add contributor guidelines if open-sourced
