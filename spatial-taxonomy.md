# Spatial Taxonomy & Belonging Logic

A system for understanding where things go in your physical space—not just what they are.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Instead of simply tracking items, the system should develop a sense of:
- Where things *belong*
- What makes something *different from trash*
- How to suggest logical *groupings or zones*

---

## 🗂️ Zone-Based Spatial Mapping

Define named areas of your space, inspired by real-world systems (like stores):

| Zone ID             | Description                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `garage/tools-wall` | Pegboard-hanging hand tools         |
| `office/cable-bin`  | USB, HDMI, and video cables         |
| `closet/gadget-box` | Obsolete or rarely used devices     |
| `underdesk/float`   | Items not yet filed                 |
| `bookshelf/ai`      | AI, ML, and cognitive books         |

---

## 🛠️ The System Can Ask:

- “Where would you look for this later?”
- “Is this something you use often?”
- “What makes this not garbage?”
- “How is this different from others like it?”
- “Do you want to name a new area for this?”

---

## 🤖 Smart Suggestions

When an item has no clear match, the app may:
- Recommend an existing zone (based on past item features or photos)
- Offer to create a new named zone
- Highlight why the item is unusual
- Ask for help labeling what makes this item unique

## 🧺 Examples

1. **Yellow USB-C Cable**
   - Suggest: `office/cable-bin`
   - Ask: “Is the color important? Should this go in a visible drawer?”

2. **Mystery Gadget**
   - Suggest: `closet/gadget-box`
   - Ask: “Do you remember what this does? If not, should it go in a bin marked 'evaluate or toss'?”

3. **Power Supply Brick**
   - Suggest: New Zone → `garage/power-parts`
   - Ask: “Is this reusable, or is it specific to a long-gone device?”

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Not all clutter is trash.
Some things don’t belong *yet*.
This system learns how *you* assign meaning—and helps you build a place for things that deserve to be kept.


---

## 🧠 Dealing with Ambiguous Zones

Sometimes, items in 'fast access' areas aren't shameful or even disorganized—they just don't have a **natural home yet**.

- These may be:
  - In-progress project parts
  - Items with unknown classification
  - Temporary setups with long lifespans

---

## 🔍 Smart Queries for Space Health

The system should support questions that uncover low-confidence organization:

- **"What items don’t have a known zone?"**
- **"What zones are overloaded or have conflicting items?"**
- **"What zones contain things not accessed in over 1 year?"**
- **"What can I promote from float to permanent home?"**
- **"Which bins contain orphaned project parts?"**
- **"Show me things with no photo, tag, or last-use data."**

These queries help move from passive storage to **active curation**, allowing periodic review cycles and proactive cleanup.

---

## 📍 Future Idea: "Zone Health Score"

Each zone could be scored based on:
- % of items with last-access timestamps
- # of items flagged "unknown" or "misc"
- Storage density (e.g., full bin vs. sparse drawer)
- User feedback (items moved in/out frequently)

Use this to identify:
- Clutter hot zones
- Hidden long-term storage
- Forgotten active projects
